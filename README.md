# Prisoner-Dilemma
This project is a recreation of the many simulations focusing on the prisoner's dilemma in repeated games. The most famous of such simulations and studies being Axelrod, R. (1984). The Evolution of Cooperation. 

Using interfaces for strategies, reward matrices and game rules allows for easy modularity, modification, and mutation.
